# learning-cs
Re-learning C# after a long prolonged break.

Roadmap: https://github.com/users/someguyagainv2/projects/2/views/1

All notes will be documented in a obsidian file which will be added to the GitHub, the obisidian notes will have each section linked and making examples of everything I learn I picked up this researching method from a video I watched correlated to being able to intake and maintain information you learn this will help me in a long run and allow me to do a lot more.

# Projects in C#

Each project will have a folder designated to it which will have a readme.md summarising the task then the code how it was solved then any adaptions later on. This allows for others of similiar interest to copy project ideas and try use it themselves for projects to do when learning C# I love idea of inspiring people so I'm more than happy to do so.
